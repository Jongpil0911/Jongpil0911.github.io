# [Peplography—a passive 3D photon counting imaging through scattering media](https://opg.optica.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-41-22-5401)
This paper is written by Prof. Myungjin Cho, and Prof. Bahram Javidi at Hankyung National University and University of Connecticut, respectively.<br/>
This review consists of [Theory](#Theory), [Result](#Result), and codes. <br/>
The paper is written in a simple structure, so everyone can easily follow. <br/>

## Introduction
To overcome the harsh visible conditions, several methods have been proposed. <br/>
This paper assumed more hazy images than other papers. <br/>

## Theory
### Fog Estimation Method
They proposed the hazy is followed the Gaussian distribution



### Low Intensity Restore Method

## Result
