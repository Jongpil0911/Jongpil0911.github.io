# Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM)
DHM is one of the 3D imaging technology using coherence of light. The coherence of light is made by collimated beam (laser) and interferometer. There are a few interferometers, such as mach-zehnder interferometer and lateral shearing plate (common path) interferometer. For more detailed explain, first of all i will introduce the mach-zehnder interferometer.
## Mach-Zehnder interferometer
Mach-zehnder interferometers use two paths for coherence of light. First, the collimated beam is divided by the beam splitter. One of them is passed transmissive object (**object beam**), and the other is the **reference beam** going directly to the image sensor. The two beams are the interference of the image sensor. When we take images from an image sensor, we can obtain a holographic image with **fringe pattern**.<br/>
Before the continue, there are important things. When we setuped the experiment, the reference beam path and object beam path must be **same lengths**. Otherwise, the interferometer can't make inteference between object beam and reference beam. Also, we can't use the coherence of light.

## Fringe pattern
The fringe pattern is made by coherence of light. When object beam and reference beam are superpositioned in image sensor, we can obtain the fringe pattern. The superposition of the reference beam and object beam is make fringe pattern such as sinusoidal signal, so when we observe the hologram image in frequnecy domain, we can find the two symmetric delta function.
$$\mathcal{F\{sin(\omega_0 t)\}}=\frac{1}{2}\delta(\omega_0)+\frac{1}{2}\delta(-\omega_0)$$
$$holo=R^*O+RO^*+|R|^2+|O|^2$$

## How to get holographic image?
- We take two images, such as reference image (without object), and object iamge (within object)
- Extracted phase information from the delta position
- Subtracted object image's phaser and reference image's phaser
- Using phase unwrapping for extracted height information of the object
- Observe the 3D profile
