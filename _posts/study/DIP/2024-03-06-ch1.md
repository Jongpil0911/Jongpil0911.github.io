# Intensity Transformations
In image processing, one of the important things is the intensity. Depended to intensity, we can see and can't see the target. if the target's instensity is too low, we can't reconized the target.<br/>
To solve the this problem, i will introduce several **Intensity Transformations**, in this post, i will show the *Log Transformation*, *Power-Law (Gamma) Transformation*, *Histogram processing* <br/> <br/> <br/>
Basically, i using the python for image processing, so these source codes are also python codes.<br/>
```python
!pip install numpy, matplotlib, opencv-python
```

## Log Transformation
$$s=c \times log(1+r)$$


## Power-Law Transfromation
$$s=cr^{\gamma}$$


## Histogram processing
### Histogram Equalization
### Histogram matching (specification)
